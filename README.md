# AgriShare Backend

**Blockchain-based Farmland & Livestock Tokenization Platform**  
Farmers tokenize yield rights → Investors buy fractional shares → Fiat payments only (Telebirr/Chapa)

**Tech Stack**  
Node.js + Express + MongoDB + Ethers.js + Hardhat + JWT

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Fill MONGO_URI and PRIVATE_KEY
npm run dev
```

## Listing Update Timeline API

Farmers can publish chronological listing updates (title, body, images, posted date) that are visible to all authenticated users.

### Behavior

- A first update is posted automatically when a listing is created:
  - `title`: `Listing launched for investment`
  - `body`: `Listing launched for investment`
- Any authenticated user can read updates.
- Only the listing owner farmer can create, edit, or delete updates.
- Farmers can create updates even after payday.
- Farmers can edit/delete updates only before payday.
- Maximum 3 images per update.

### Endpoints

  - `title` (required, 5-120 chars)

## Listing Reviews API

Investors who have purchased shares in a listing can post one text review per listing. All authenticated users can read reviews.

### Behavior

- Only investors who hold an investment contract for the listing can post a review.
- Each investor is limited to **one review per listing**. Attempting to submit a second review returns `409 Conflict`.
- Investors can edit and delete only their own reviews.
- Reviews are returned in **chronological order** (oldest first) with page-based pagination.
- Any authenticated user (farmer, investor, admin) can read reviews.
